# Digit Recognizer

Digit Recognizer is a PyTorch-based project for handwritten digit classification.  
It demonstrates how to train and evaluate both a simple CNN and a ResNet-based model on the Kaggle Digit Recognizer dataset.

---

### This project includes:
```bash
* Custom CNN implementation
* ResNet-based implementation
* Dataset and Dataloader setup
* Training and Validation pipelines
* Result visualization and submission generation
```

---

## Implementations
1. **Simple_CNN.ipnb** – SImple and Custom CNN implementation.  
2. **ResNet.ipnb** – ResNet-based model that improves feature learning and achieves higher accuracy.

---

### Result:
-Simple CNN Model Accuracy : 98.21%      
-ResNet Model Accuracy  : 98.78%

---

### Future Improvements
- Experiment with deeper ResNet variants or lightweight CNNs.  
- Apply data augmentation and learning rate scheduling for further gains.  
- Develop a simple interface for users to draw and predict digits in real time.
