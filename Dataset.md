# Digit Recognizer Dataset

## Overview

- **Name**: Digit Recognizer  
- **Source**: Kaggle ‚Äî [Digit Recognizer Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data)
- **Description**:  
  This dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0‚Äì9). The goal is to build a classifier that correctly identifies which digit is in each image.

## Dataset Structure

| File | Rows | Columns / Image Size | Purpose |
|------|------|-----------------------|---------|
| `train.csv` | 42,000 | 785 (1 label column + 784 pixel columns) | Training data: each row has a label and corresponding 28√ó28 pixel values. |
| `test.csv`  | 28,000 | 784 pixel columns only | Test data: no label; used for evaluating predictions. |
| `sample_submission.csv` | 28,000 | 2 columns (ImageId, Label) | Format example for submission: IDs with predicted labels. |

## Data Fields

- **Label** (only in `train.csv`): integer in [0‚Äì9] representing the digit shown in the image.  
- **Pixel Columns**:  
  - `pixel0` through `pixel783` (or similarly named) ‚Äî each represents a grayscale intensity value (0‚Äì255) of a pixel in the flattened 28√ó28 image, in row-major order.  
  - 0 typically means white/background, 255 means black/foreground (or vice versa, depending on preprocessing).

## Image Details

- **Type**: Grayscale  
- **Dimensions**: 28 √ó 28 pixels  
- **Flattening**: Images flattened into vectors (1√ó784) for storage in CSV; can be reshaped back into 28√ó28 for image tasks.
